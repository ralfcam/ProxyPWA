# Authentication Fix for Proxy Service

## Issue Summary
The error `{"code":401,"message":"Missing authorization header"}` was occurring when navigating to `https://proxy-pwa.vercel.app/dashboard/proxy` due to unauthenticated API calls being made during the React app initialization.

## Root Cause
1. When the React app loads at `/dashboard/proxy`, it immediately tries to fetch user profile data and active proxy sessions
2. If the user is not authenticated or the session has expired, Supabase returns a 401 error with "Missing authorization header"
3. This error was visible briefly before the authentication redirect kicked in

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frontend Authentication Checks
Updated the following hooks to check for valid sessions before making API calls:

- **`useUserProfile` hook**: Now checks for a valid session before fetching user profile
- **`ProxyControl` component**: Validates session before loading active proxy sessions

### 2. Error Handling
- Added proper error handling to suppress expected 401 errors during authentication checks
- Created an `ErrorBoundary` component that catches authentication errors and redirects to login

### 3. Edge Function Improvements
The proxy service Edge Function already supports URL-based authentication:
```
https://svgjlampoqkmahhpyahy.supabase.co/functions/v1/proxy-service/{sessionId}/{encodedTargetUrl}
```

When accessing the function without parameters, it now returns a helpful message instead of an error.

## How the Proxy Service Works

### Authentication Methods
The proxy service supports two authentication modes:

1. **URL Path Authentication** (for iframe/direct browser access):
   ```
   GET /proxy-service/{sessionId}/{encodedTargetUrl}
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   https://svgjlampoqkmahhpyahy.supabase.co/functions/v1/proxy-service/abc123/https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com
   ```

2. **Query Parameter Mode** (simple proxy):
   ```
   GET /proxy-service?url=https://example.com
   ```

### Frontend Implementation
The `DirectProxyViewer` component correctly constructs the proxy URL with the session ID:
```typescript
const getProxyUrl = (url: string) => {
  const encodedUrl = encodeURIComponent(url)
  return `${proxyBaseUrl}/${sessionId}/${encodedUrl}`
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Authenticated User Flow**:
   - Log in at `https://proxy-pwa.vercel.app/auth`
   - Navigate to `https://proxy-pwa.vercel.app/dashboard/proxy`
   - Start a proxy session
   - The DirectProxyViewer will open with the proxy iframe

2. **Unauthenticated User Flow**:
   - Navigate directly to `https://proxy-pwa.vercel.app/dashboard/proxy`
   - You should be redirected to `/auth` without seeing the 401 error

3. **Direct Edge Function Access**:
   - Visit `https://svgjlampoqkmahhpyahy.supabase.co/functions/v1/proxy-service`
   - You should see a helpful message about how to use the service

## Security Considerations
- The Edge Function validates the session ID against the database
- It checks user balance before allowing proxy requests
- All requests are logged for usage tracking
- CORS headers are properly configured

## Next Steps
If you still encounter issues:
1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Check the browser console for any errors
3. Ensure your Supabase session is valid
4. Verify the Edge Function is deployed correctly
