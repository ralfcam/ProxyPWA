# Proxy Content Rendering Fixes

## Overview

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve proxy content rendering issues in Supabase Edge Functions.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Sandbox Restrictions**: Iframes were sandboxed without necessary permissions, blocking script execution
2. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Restrictions**: The CSP was too restrictive, blocking inline styles and scripts
3. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Headers needed to be more permissive for proxy functionality

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Response Headers (proxy-service/index.ts)

Updated the `createResponseHeaders` function with:
- More permissive CSP allowing scripts, styles, and various content types
- Added `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` for proper iframe embedding
- Removed restrictive headers that could block content

```typescript
// Key CSP directives added:
- script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' *
- style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *
- frame-ancestors 'self' *
```

### 2. HTML Modification Enhancements (proxy-service/index.ts)

Enhanced the `modifyHtmlForProxy` function to:
- Remove sandbox attributes from iframes within proxied content
- Inject helper scripts for better URL resolution
- Override fetch and XMLHttpRequest to handle relative URLs
- Add message listener for script execution support

### 3. CORS Headers Update (_shared/cors.ts)

- Changed default origin from localhost to wildcard (`*`)
- Added logic to handle credentials properly
- Made headers more permissive for proxy use cases

### 4. Client-Side Iframe Enhancements

Updated both `ProxyViewer.tsx` and `DirectProxyViewer.tsx` with:
- Additional sandbox permissions: `allow-pointer-lock`, `allow-orientation-lock`
- Extended allow permissions: `autoplay`, `fullscreen`, `picture-in-picture`, `xr-spatial-tracking`
- Added `referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"` for better content loading

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy the Edge Function**:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   supabase functions deploy proxy-service
   ```

2. **Test Locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   supabase start
   supabase functions serve proxy-service --no-verify-jwt
   ```

3. **Frontend Updates**:
   The frontend changes are already in place and will take effect immediately.

## Testing the Fixes

1. Open your PWA and navigate to the proxy viewer
2. Enter a target URL (e.g., https://wikipedia.org)
3. The content should now render properly with:
   - Scripts executing correctly
   - Styles displaying properly
   - Interactive elements working

## Known Limitations

- Some websites with strict security policies may still block proxy access
- Adult content sites often have additional restrictions
- Sites using advanced anti-bot measures may not work properly

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify the Edge Function logs in Supabase dashboard
3. Ensure the session is active and has sufficient balance
4. Try simpler websites first (e.g., Wikipedia, news sites)

## Security Considerations

While these changes make the proxy more permissive, they're necessary for proper content rendering. The proxy still:
- Validates sessions and user authentication
- Tracks usage and enforces limits
- Prevents access to local resources
- Maintains user isolation between sessions
